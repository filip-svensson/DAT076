### NOTE: We've done alot of pair-programming, trying to utilize gihubs Co-Author. Unfortunatly we have not got it working all the time as you can see in some of the big commits. This has generated the "Collaborators" tab useless as it doesnt reflect the actual work. We refer you to our report and self-evaluations instead.
